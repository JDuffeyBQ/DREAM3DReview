# Anisotropy
Anisotropy is a plugin for DREAM.3D which is an open source software that allows to process and analyze multidimensional data, including data from three-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (3D EBSD). This plugin contains filters that help to analyse an anisotropy in morphology of grains and reconstruct a 3D data set of anisotropic material from 2D slices.
