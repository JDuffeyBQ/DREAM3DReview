# TransformationPhase #


# Intro #

This repository holds filters for DREAM3D (Version 6.x currently) that act on _Transformation_ phases. The filters in this plugin are **HIGHLY** experimental and can give erroneous results. The plugin is not under any active development as of Q1 2018 due to lack of funding.

If you need more help with a filter, please consider asking your question on the [DREAM3D Users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/dream3d-users)

## Transformation Phase Plans ##

Updated: 7/28/14

+ StatsGenerator Tabs
+ Size
+ Omega-3
+ Shape
+ Variant
+ Axis-ODF
+ Burgers Relationship (need bulk load feature)
	1 or 2 parallel sets of planes
	1 or 2 parallel sets of directions

+ Transformation Phase Properties
+ Parent Phase
+ Fraction of Cross Secting Transformation

+ Need an orientation relationship and morphological relationship – need to add these in (stats generator?)
+ Have to run match crystallography before this filter on the primary phase
+ Transformation phase needs to know its parent (different than precipitate phase)
+ Make an enumeration of known orientation relationships
	+ Alpha Laths
	+ Pearlite colony size
	+ Parallel plates
	+ Grow off GBs
	+ Beta - HCP
	+ Colony size
	+ Variant GBs
